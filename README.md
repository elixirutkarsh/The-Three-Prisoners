# The-Three-Prisoners

Problem statement:

There are three prisoners who are being held in separate cells. Each prisoner is told that if they confess, they will be released, but if they all confess, they will all be executed. If no one confesses, they will all be released. The prisoners do not know what the other prisoners have decided to do. What should each prisoner do?

Solution:

Each prisoner should confess. This is because if one prisoner confesses, the other two prisoners will be executed regardless of whether they confess or not. Therefore, it is in the best interest of each prisoner to confess, even if the other prisoners do not.
